# My First Project to majorly involve C

This projects goal is to emulate the oh so popular gameboy :D
The project will use Raylib but everything else will be created for the project.

- Goal
   - Get virtual gameboy to execute code
      - Emulate the Gameboy `cpu`
         - Handle `OpCodes`
      - Read code from Memory
         - Figure out next step?
   - Draw the Screen
      - Emulate the Gameboy `ppu` (Picture Proccessing Unit)
         - Figure out next step?
   - Get virtual gameboy to play `pokemon red`
      - ~~Read Game Rom into memory~~
      - Figure out next step?

## Side notes
